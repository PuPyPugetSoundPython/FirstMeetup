August 9th at Facebook's Seattle Office

Originally we wanted to launch in September, but serendipity provides us the opportunity to launch with Lyn Root the founder of PyLadies SF speaking. This provides us the awesome chance to launch with a focus on making our community female-friendly. 

I've added Dusty, Yannick, Ritwik, and Avilay as owners of the organization. I couldn't find Larry Hastings's Github username. Please Dusty or Yannick, feel free to add Larry as an owner. 

I'll ask Brian Nitz if he's got a Github account. 

Looking at PyCon's use of Github, I'll pattern this after PyCon's example. 

Thank you you everybody.
